## 1. 2017-2022 Nobel laurates in Physics.xlsx
Li et al. (2019).(Li et al.'s dataset[https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/6NJ5RN]) The dataset contains 193 Nobel laureates from 1902 to 2016, including the laureate’s name, award time, laureate’s paper title, paper publication time, Prize-winning paper label and other data. I supplemented the paper data of totally 18 laureates from 2017–2022 from Web of Science and Scopus to the dataset, and identified these laureates’ Prize-winning papers according to the evaluation criteria proposed by Li et al. (2019).
