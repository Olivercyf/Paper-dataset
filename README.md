## 1. 2017-2022 Nobel laurates in Physics.xlsx
Li et al. (2019) ([Li et al.'s dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/6NJ5RN), [Li et al.'s paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0033-6)) created a dataset about Nobel laureates. The dataset contains 193 Nobel laureates from 1902 to 2016, including the laureate’s name, award time, laureate’s paper title, paper publication time, Prize-winning paper label and other data. Here we supplemented the paper data of totally 18 laureates from 2017–2022 from Web of Science and Scopus to the dataset, and identified these laureates’ Prize-winning papers according to the evaluation criteria proposed by Li et al. (2019).
